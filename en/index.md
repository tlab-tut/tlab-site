# Takahashi Group (T-lab)
System Engineering Laboratory — Department of Mechanical Engineering, Toyohashi University of Technology

**From industrial automation to robotics in everyday spaces.**  
We develop a cost-effective localization method **VGM (Visual-Geometric Matching)** and apply it to **manufacturing and logistics systems** for digital transformation (DX) and automation.  
Building upon these achievements, we further extend our technologies to **living-space digital twins**, tackling the challenges of autonomous robots operating in complex human environments.

## What we work on
- **Industrial Applications:** applying our localization and mapping technologies to **manufacturing and logistics systems**, enabling scalable digital twins and intelligent automation  
- **Low-cost localization (VGM):** client–server localization using a monocular RGB camera and pre-built maps  
- **Living-space Digital Twin:** expanding industrial CPS concepts into everyday environments such as campuses, hospitals, libraries, and malls  
- **Cleanliness Management:** floor cleanliness estimation, planning, and execution with autonomous cleaning robots  
- **Platforms:** ROS2, indoor mapping, long-term operation, evaluation at real sites
